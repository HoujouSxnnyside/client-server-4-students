# Python Client-Server App

## Introduction

This repository contains a simple **Python Client-Server** application that demonstrates the basic concepts of network communication. The app is designed for educational purposes, helping students understand how client-server architectures work and how data is exchanged over a network.

## What is a Client-Server Model?

In a **client-server** model, the **server** is a program that waits for client requests. The **client** is another program that sends a request to the server and receives a response. The server and client communicate over a network (such as the internet or a local network) using predefined protocols and port numbers.

## Overview of This Project

This project consists of two Python scripts:
- **Server Script**: Listens for client connections, accepts messages, and responds.
- **Client Script**: Connects to the server, sends a message, and receives a response.

Both scripts use the `socket` library in Python to handle networking.

## How It Works

1. **Server Script**:
   - The server binds to a specified IP address and port number.
   - It listens for incoming client connections.
   - When a client connects, the server receives the client's message, processes it, and sends a response back to the client.

2. **Client Script**:
   - The client connects to the server using its IP address and port number.
   - It sends a message (request) to the server.
   - The client then waits for a response from the server and prints it.

## Setup and Running the App

### Prerequisites
You need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine. No additional libraries are required as we are using Python's built-in `socket` library.

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-client-server-app.git

2. **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd python-client-server-app

3. **Running the Server**: Open a terminal and run the server script:
    ```bash
    python server.py

    The server will start and listen for incoming connections.

4. **Running the Client**: Open another terminal (or use a different machine) and run the client script:
    ```bash
    python client.py

The client will connect to the server and send a message. You should see a response from the server in the client terminal.

## Example Interaction
Here is an example of how the server and client will interact:

### Server Output:

Server started and listening...
Client connected from ('127.0.0.1', 54321)
Received message: "Hello from the client!"
Sent response: "Message received: Hello from the client!"

### Client Output:
Connected to the server at 127.0.0.1:8080
Sent: Hello from the client!
Received: Message received: Hello from the client!

# Customization
**IP Address**: By default, the server listens on localhost (127.0.0.1). If you want to make the server accessible from other machines in your network, change the IP address in the server.py file.

**Port Number**: You can change the port number used for communication by modifying the server.py and client.py scripts. Make sure both scripts use the same port.

# Learning Outcomes

By following and running this project, you should learn:

1. How client-server communication works.
2. How to use Python’s socket library for basic networking.
3. How data is transmitted between clients and servers in a networked environment.

# Expanding the Project
Once you’re familiar with this basic client-server interaction, here are some ideas to expand the project:

    - Implement multithreading on the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
    - Add encryption to the data being transmitted to improve security.
    - Explore HTTP protocols by building a simple web server and client.
    - Handle larger data such as file transfers between the client and server.
